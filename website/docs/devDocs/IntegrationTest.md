## Introduction
1.  Now, Apache Submarine supports two kinds of integration test: `test-e2e` and `test-k8s`. These two modules can be found in the [submarine/submarine-test](https://github.com/apache/submarine/tree/master/submarine-test) directory.

2.  Currently, there are some differences between `test-e2e` and `test-k8s` in operation mode. To elaborate, `test-e2e` needs to deploy Apache Submarine locally, while `test-k8s` deploys Apache Submarine via k8s.

3.  These two test modules can be applied to different test scenarios. (In the future, these two test modules may be combined or adjusted)

## k8s test

k8s test: When the user submits the code to his/her repository or the `apache/submarine` git repository, the travis test task will automatically start.

test-k8s runs test cases in travis. It will first create a k8s cluster by using the kind tool in travis,

and then compile and package the submarine project in `submarine-dist` directory to build a docker image.

Then use this latest code to build a docker image and deploy a submarine system in k8s. Then run test case in the `test-k8s/..` directory.

### Run k8s test in locally

Executing the following command will perform the following actions:

```
mvn -Phadoop-3.2 clean package install -DskipTests verify -DskipRat -am -pl submarine-test/test-k8s
```

1. The submarine project will be compiled and packaged to generate `submarine-dist/target/submarine-<version>.tar.gz`
2. Call the `submarine-cloud/hack/integration-test.sh` script

    + Call the `build.sh` script under `submarine/dev-support/docker-images/` to generate the latest `submarine`, `database` and `operator` docker images.
    + Call `submarine-cloud/hack/kind-cluster-build.sh` to create a k8s cluster
    + Call `submarine-cloud/hack/deploy-submarine.sh` to deploy the submarine system in the k8s cluster using the latest `submarine`, `database` and `operator` docker images.
    + Call the test cases in `submarine-test/test-k8s/` for testing.

### Run k8s test in travis

Each time a code is submitted, travis is automatically triggered for testing.

## E2E test

### E2E tests can be executed both locally and in Travis (For workbench developer)
* Run E2E tests locally:
  * Step1: Follow [HowToRun.md](https://github.com/apache/submarine/blob/master/website/docs/adminDocs/yarn/workbench/HowToRun.md) to launch the submarine-server and database.
  * Step2: Run workbench (Angular version) locally
  ```
  cd submarine/submarine-workbench/workbench-web
  npm start
  // Check 127.0.0.1:4200
  ```
  * Step3: Modify the port from 8080 to 4200
    * [WebDriverManager.java](https://github.com/apache/submarine/blob/master/submarine-test/test-e2e/src/test/java/org/apache/submarine/WebDriverManager.java): `url = "http://localhost:8080";` --> `url = "http://localhost:4200";`
    * [Your Unit test case](https://github.com/apache/submarine/tree/master/submarine-test/test-e2e/src/test/java/org/apache/submarine/integration): `8080` --> `4200`
  * Step4: Comment the `headless` option
    * [ChromeWebDriverProvider.java](https://github.com/apache/submarine/blob/master/submarine-test/test-e2e/src/test/java/org/apache/submarine/ChromeWebDriverProvider.java): `chromeOptions.addArguments("--headless");` --> `//chromeOptions.addArguments("--headless");`
    * With the `headless` option, the selenium will be executed in background.
  * Step5: Run E2E test cases (Please check the following section **Run the existing tests**)
* Run E2E tests in Travis:
  *  Step1: Make sure that the port must be 8080 rather than in [WebDriverManager.java](https://github.com/apache/submarine/blob/master/submarine-test/test-e2e/src/test/java/org/apache/submarine/WebDriverManager.java) and [all test cases](https://github.com/apache/submarine/tree/master/submarine-test/test-e2e/src/test/java/org/apache/submarine/integration).
  *  Step2: Make sure that the `headless` option is not commented in [ChromeWebDriverProvider.java](https://github.com/apache/submarine/blob/master/submarine-test/test-e2e/src/test/java/org/apache/submarine/ChromeWebDriverProvider.java).
  *  Step3: If you push the commit to Github, the Travis CI will execute automatically and you can check it in `https://travis-ci.com/${your_github_account}/${your_repo_name}`.
### Run the existing tests.
##### Move to the working directory.
```
cd submarine/submarine-test/test-e2e
```
##### Compile & Run.

> Following command will compile all files and run **all** files ending with "IT" in the [directory](https://github.com/apache/submarine/tree/master/submarine-test/test-e2e/src/test/java/org/apache/submarine/integration).
*   For linux
 ```
 mvn verify
 ```
*   For MacOS
```
mvn clean install -U
```
> Run a specific testcase
```
mvn -Dtest=${your_test_case_file_name} test //ex: mvn -Dtest=loginIT test
```

##### Result
If all of the function under test are succeeded, it will show.
```
BUILD SUCCESS
```
Otherwise, it will show.
```
BUILD FAILURE
```

### Add your own integration test
1. Create a new file ending with "IT" under "submarine/submarine-test/test-e2e/src/test/java/org/apache/submarine/integration/".
2. Your public class is recommended to extend AbstractSubmarineIT. The class AbstractSubmarineIT contains some commonly used functions.
```java
  WebElement pollingWait(final By locator, final long timeWait); // Find element on the website.
  void clickAndWait(final By locator); // Click element and wait for 1 second.
  void sleep(long millis, boolean logOutput); // Let system sleep a period of time.
```
3. There are also some commonly used functions except in AbstractSubmarineIT.java.
```java
  // In WebDriverManager.java:
  public static WebDriver getWebDriver(); // This return a firefox webdriver which has been set to your workbench website.
```
4. Add [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/) annotation before your testing function, e.g., @Beforeclass, @Test, and @AfterClass. You can refer to [loginIT.java](https://github.com/apache/submarine/blob/master/submarine-test/test-e2e/src/test/java/org/apache/submarine/integration/loginIT.java).
5. Use command mentioned above to compile and run to test whether it works as your anticipation.
